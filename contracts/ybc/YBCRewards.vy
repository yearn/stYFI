@notice YBC module that deals with distributing rewards originating from the Collective's staking position(s).
        Any state change forwarded by the upstream YBC weight aggregator results in a rewards claim through
        the YBC and is distributed proportionally to each member according to their aggregated staked balance.
        The contract can be killed, permanently disabling further yield claiming from the YBC while keeping
        the ability for members to claim already earned rewards intact.
