@title Vote Boost Reward Distributor

@notice A component to the RewardDistributor, basing reward weights on the user's total stake in 
        the system and the participation rate in governance voting. The participation is determined
        by the fraction of proposals the user has voted on in a sliding window of 6 epochs.
        This component takes into account staking of the naked token as well as the liquid locker tokens
        and the legacy voting escrow and applies the legacy boost on the latter two.
